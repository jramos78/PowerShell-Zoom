Every API call to Zoom requires generating a JWT. TO get started you must create a JWT app on your Zoom account. Once you've created it, run GenerateZoomToken.ps1 to generate a temporary JWT before making any API calls to Zoom.

The Zoom API documentation can be found at https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api
